# Medical-analysis
Create a model that predict each kind of disease 

## Objectives ?
-> **Main Objective** : Early disease detection using machine learning (The earlier detection of disease may lead to more cures or longer survival).
-> Preserve data between attending doctor, the user and the developers
-> Have easily access to medical background & centralise these information (health card, health record)

## How ? 
-> Create an app/web that will suggest different types of diseases depending on their health status

## Collaborators
-> Attending doctor : Understand their need with the app. Direct communication with the users 
-> Users (main actor) : Sends their data through the app.  
-> Developers : Develop an AI based system to suggest different diseases the user may have depending on the data collected 
-> Laboratories : Suggestion on different diseases + Data collection
-> Investors/Sponsors : Fund the project (app, server, cloud)

## Famous diseases that must be detected :
-> Pakinson : Data available
-> Tuberculosis
-> Heart disease


## Types of data for possible diseases detection :
-> Cardio arrhythmia : ?
-> Voice frequency : Parkinson
-> Images

## Typed of external & connected device for data collection (optional)
-> Blood test sensor
-> Cardio frequency sensor
-> Voice frequency sensor
-> Thermometer
-> Blood pressure 

## Developers structure :
-> Doctor : Role of product owner. Helps defining the correct needs of the app 
-> Data engineer : Data structur and data collection 
-> Data science : Health prediction
-> App developpement (Android, IOS later) : Front end & back end (data base) 

## Important information
-> IHM for user
-> IHM for doctors
