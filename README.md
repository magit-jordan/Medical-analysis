# Medical-analysis
Create a model that predict each kind of disease 

## Objectives ?
* **Main Objective** : Early disease detection using machine learning (The earlier detection of disease may lead to more cures or longer survival).
* Preserve data between attending doctor, the user and the developers.
* Have easily access to medical background & centralise these information (health card, health record).

## How ? 
* Create an app/web that will suggest different types of diseases depending on their health status.

## Collaborators
* Attending doctor : Understand their need with the app. Direct communication with the users .
* Users (main actor) : Sends their data through the app.  
* Developers : Develop an AI based system to suggest different diseases the user may have depending on the data collected.
* Laboratories : Suggestion on different diseases + Data collection.
* Investors/Sponsors : Fund the project (app, server, cloud).

## Famous diseases that must be detected :
* Pakinson : Data available.
* Tuberculosis.
* Heart disease.
* Chronic Kidney. 


## Types of data for possible diseases detection :
* Cardio arrhythmia. 
* Blood.
* Voice frequency : Parkinson.
* Images (optional).

## Typed of external & connected device for data collection (optional)
* Blood test sensor.
* Cardio frequency sensor.
* Voice frequency sensor.
* Thermometer.
* Blood pressure. 

## Developers structure :
* Doctor : Role of product owner. Helps defining the correct needs of the app.
* Data engineer : Data structure and data collection.
* Data scientist : Health prediction.
* App developpement (Android, IOS later) : Front end & back end (data base).

## Important information
* IHM for user.
* IHM for doctors.

## To Do list Short Term
- [x] Create README with project objectives.
- [X] Talk to a doctor for different ideas.
- [X] State Of The Art (similare projects and model predictions).
- [X] Look for Hematology Disorders (blood diseases).
- [X] Business Model with Canvas.
- [ ] Find a logo, a name and a slogan.

#### Blood test diseases
- [X] Create a list of blood test diseases.
- [X] Find or create new dataset with different diseases linked to blood tests.

#### Parkinson diseases
- [ ] Work on parkinson voice frequency dataset.
- [ ] Work on parkinson spiral drawings. 

## To Do list Mid Term
- [ ] Work on app (find frameworks and IDE's).
- [ ] Find doctors and laboratories that will help on the project.
